# Vulnerability Report
*updated May 17, 2020*

## Vulnerability 1:

### Exposure
By going to the url "https://holeyforkingshirts.azurewebsites.net/Admin/Dashboard", or any other admin pages,
any user, either logged in or anonymous, would be able to access not just our entire order history, 
but also be able to alter and rewrite our entire inventory however they
wanted, offering goods that either didn't exist, or changing prices.

This could have either made customers pay for things we couldn't send to them, or get anything they want from the site for free.

### Repair
The admin dashboard and all admin-only pages have now been assigned policies that only let in one of our four admin users, otherwise,
they'll be automatically asked to sign in. This code fixed the vulnerability:  
  
  `[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]`
