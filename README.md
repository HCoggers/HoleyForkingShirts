## Web Application
We built Holey Forking Shirts because we believe every torn, hand-me-down, second-hand article of clothing that you found in the attic from back in high school deserves a second chance.  

Unlike other thrift stores, we will accept donated clothing in *ANY* condition. We want to find homes for that pair of slacks with the split seam you haven't gotten around to mending, or those socks that have been worn down so much they have a separate hole for each toe, and we won't stop lowering our prices until we do. If we have to pay you to take this shredded undershirt home, we just might do it!  

Break out your old sewing machine, and come find your next patch-up project at Holey Forking Shirts!
